1. What exactly is []?
Ans:
 [] is an empty List.

2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)
Let's pretend the spam includes the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] for the next three queries.
Ans:
spam[2]=’hello’

3. What is the value of spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)]?
Ans:
spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)]
spam[int(33 / 11)]
spam[int(3.0)]
spam[3]= d

4. What is the value of spam[-1]?
Ans: will start from last item of the list i.e.  d

5. What is the value of spam[:2]?
Ans: 
Will fetch first 2 items of the list ( at 0th index and at 1st index)
[‘a’,’b’]

Let's pretend bacon has the list [3.14, 'cat' 11, 'cat', True] for the next three questions.
6. What is the value of bacon.index('cat')?
Ans:   1


7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?
Ans:
[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]

8. How does bacon.remove('cat') change the look of the list in bacon?

Ans :  [3.14, 11, 'cat', True, 99]

9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?
Ans:
The operator for list concatenation is + and  for replication is *

10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?
Ans:
append() will add values only to the end of a list, insert() can add them anywhere in the list

11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?
Ans: del and remove() list method are two ways to remove items from a list

12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.
Ans:
len() , in , not in and for loop can be used with both list’s and string’s values , both had indexes ,both can be concatenated or replicated.

13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?
Ans:tuple are immutable while lists are not, tuple created parentheses with () while lists with square brackets []

14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?
Ans:
A=(42,)

15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?
Ans:
list(a) , tuple(a)

16. Variables that "contain" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?
Ans: 
Reference  to list values.

17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
Ans: 
copy.copy() : will create shallow copy
copy.deepcopy() : will create deep copy, will duplicate the list.
