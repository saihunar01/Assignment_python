1. What does RGBA stand for?
Ans:-->
Red-Green-Blue-Alpha

2. From the Pillow module, how do you get the RGBA value of any images?
Ans:-->
A function call to ImageColor.getcolor('CornflowerBlue', 'RGBA') will return (100, 149, 237, 255), the RGBA value for that color.

3. What is a box tuple, and how does it work?
Ans:-> A box tuple is a tuple value of four integers: the left edge x-coordinate, the top edge y-coordinate, the width, and the height, respectively.

4. Use your image and load in notebook then, How can you find out the width and height of an Image object?
Ans:-->
from PIL import Image
filepath = "geeksforgeeks.png"
img = Image.open(filepath)
#width = img.width
#height = img.height
width,height = img.size
  

5. What method would you call to get Image object for a 100×100 image, excluding the lower-left quarter of it?
Ans:-->
cat=Image.open('abc.png')
cat.size
cat.crop((0,50,50,50)).show()

6. After making changes to an Image object, how could you save it as an image file?
Ans:-->use the save() function
You simply call save() and pass in the name you want used to save your image. 
cat.save("xyz.jpg')

7. What module contains Pillow’s shape-drawing code?
Ans:-->
ImageDraw module contains Pillow’s shape-drawing code.

8. Image objects do not have drawing methods. What kind of object does? How do you get this kind of object?
Ans:-->
shapes objects are Drawing objects 
Call the drawing method from the Draw object to draw a figure. Draw an ellipse, a rectangle, and a straight line etc.
ImageDraw objects have shape-drawing methods such as point(), line(), or rectangle(). They are returned by passing the Image object to the ImageDraw.Draw() function.
