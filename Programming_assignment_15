Question 1:
Please write a program using generator to print the numbers which can be divisible by 5 and 7 between 0 and n in comma separated form while n is input by console.
Example:
If the following n is given as input to the program:
100
Then, the output of the program should be:
0,35,70

Ans:-->
def NumGenerator(n):
    for i in range(n+1):
        if i%5==0 and i%7==0:
            yield i

n=int(input())
values = []
for i in NumGenerator(n):
    values.append(str(i))

print (",".join(values))



Question 2:
Please write a program using generator to print the even numbers between 0 and n in comma separated form while n is input by console.
Example:
If the following n is given as input to the program:
10
Then, the output of the program should be:
0,2,4,6,8,10

Ans:-->
def even_num(n):
    for i in range(n+1):
        if i%2==0: 
            yield i

n=int(input())
values = []
for i in even_num(n):
    values.append(str(i))

print (",".join(values))


Question 3:
The Fibonacci Sequence is computed based on the following formula:
f(n)=0 if n=0
f(n)=1 if n=1
f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2) if n>1
Please write a program using list comprehension to print the Fibonacci Sequence in comma separated form with a given n input by console.
Example:
If the following n is given as input to the program:
7
Then, the output of the program should be:
0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13

Ans:-->
def f(n):
    if n == 0: 
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return f(n-1)+f(n-2)

x=int(input())
values = [str(f(x)) for x in range(0, n+1)]
print (",".join(values))



Question 4:
Assuming that we have some email addresses in the "username@companyname.com" format, please write program to print the user name of a given email address. Both user names and company names are composed of letters only.
Example:
If the following email address is given as input to the program:
john@google.com
Then, the output of the program should be:
john


Ans:-->
1--->
mail=input("ENter mail id: ")
user_name=mail.split('@')[0]

2--->
import re
mail=input("ENter mail id: ")
r1="(\w+)@((\w+\.)+(com))"
r2=re.match(r1,mail)
print(r2.group(1))


Question 5:
Define a class named Shape and its subclass Square. The Square class has an init function which takes a length as argument. Both classes have a area function which can print the area of the shape where Shape's area is 0 by default.

Ans:-->
class Shape():
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    def area(self):
        return 0
class Square(Shape):
    def __init__(self,l=0):
        Shape.__init__(self)
        self.l=l
    def area(self):
        return self.l*self.l
#A = Square(5)
#print(A.area())
print(Square(int(input("ENter the length : "))).area())
