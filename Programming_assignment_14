Question 1:
Define a class with a generator which can iterate the numbers, which are divisible by 7, between a given range 0 and n.

Ans:-->
class Iter:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
        
    def divide(self,n):
        for i in range(0,n):
            if i%7==0:
                print(i)
 
d=Iter()
d.divide(122)


Question 2:
Write a program to compute the frequency of the words from the input. The output should output after sorting the key alphanumerically. 
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
New to Python or choosing between Python 2 and Python 3? Read Python 2 or Python 3.
Then, the output should be:
2:2
3.:1
3?:1
New:1
Python:5
Read:1
and:1
between:1
choosing:1
or:2
to:1

Ans:-->
str1=input("Enter: ")
str_list=str1.split(' ')
#print(str_list)
frequency=Counter(sorted(str_list))
for word in frequency:
    print(f'Frequency of  {word} is : {frequency[word]}')
    

Question 3:
Define a class Person and its two child classes: Male and Female. All classes have a method "getGender" which can print "Male" for Male class and "Female" for Female class.

Ans:-->
class Person(object):
    def getGender( self ):
        return "Unknown"

class Male( Person ):
    def getGender( self ):
        return "Male"

class Female( Person ):
    def getGender( self ):
        return "Female"

m = Male()
f= Female()
print (m.getGender())
print (f.getGender())



Question 4:
Please write a program to generate all sentences where subject is in ["I", "You"] and verb is in ["Play", "Love"] and the object is in ["Hockey","Football"].

Ans:-->
subjects=["I", "You"]
verbs=["Play", "Love"]
objects=["Hockey","Football"]
for i in range(len(subjects)):
    for j in range(len(verbs)):
        for k in range(len(objects)):
            sentence = (f'{subjects[i]} {verbs[j]} {objects[k]}')
            print (sentence)
            

Question 5:
Please write a program to compress and decompress the string "hello world!hello world!hello world!hello world!".

Ans:-->
import zlib
s = b'hello world!hello world!hello world!hello world!'
t = zlib.compress(s,2)
print(t)
print (zlib.decompress(t))



6.Please write a binary search function which searches an item in a sorted list. The function should return the index of element to be searched in the list.

Ans:-->

from bisect import bisect_left
 
def BinarySearch(a, x):
    i = bisect_left(a, x)
    if i != len(a) and a[i] == x:
        return i,x
    else:
        return False
 
a  = [1, 2, 4, 4, 8]

b,a = BinarySearch(a, int(input("Enter Number: ")))
if res == False:
    print(x, "is absent")
else:
    print("First occurrence of", a, "is present at", b)
