fileExtType = input('Enter the type of file to copy ( .pdf or .jpg): ').lower()
dest = input('Enter the path of the destination folder: ')

for foldername, subfolders, filenames in os.walk(sourcePath):
    for filename in filenames:
        if filename.lower().endswith(fileExtType):
            #print(foldername + ‘\\’ + filename)
            copySourcePath = os.path.join(foldername, filename)
            #print(copySourcePath)
            shutil.copy(copySourcePath, destPath)
        else:
            continue
